# signup-login-python
A simple example of sign-up and login code using Python. This code uses dictionaries to store user information and basic file handling to save and retrieve data.

Please note that this is a very basic example and should not be used for production-level applications without significant security enhancements.
This code provides a simple command-line interface for users to sign up and log in. The user data is stored in a JSON file (user_data.json) in the same directory as the script.

Keep in mind that this code lacks proper security measures (such as password hashing and salting) and should not be used in a production environment without significant enhancements for security. For real-world applications, it's recommended to use dedicated authentication libraries or frameworks that provide secure user management.
